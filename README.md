For this lab you will explore compound data types (objects) and file I/O.

Download <u>lab8.zip</u>, place it in your CPE101 directory, and unzip the file. This file includes four subdirectories (corresponding to the different parts of the lab).

<h1>Functions on Structured Data</h1>

This part will be executed with: <strong>python funcs_objects_tests.py</strong>

<table width="613">

   <td width="604">Objects</td>

  </tr>

</table>

Define a class to represent a two-dimensional point. In the funcs_objects directory, create a file named objects.py. You will define a class in objects.py to represent the structure of Point objects. The class Point type will need two attributes (named x and y); as before, this means that the __init__ function must take these two arguments (in addition to self) and initialize the attributes within self.

Define a class to represent a circle. Add this class to the objects.py file. The class Circle type will need two attributes to represent the center point (this will be an object of the Point class) and the radius.

Be sure to test your __init__ functions by creating objects and verifying that the attributes have been properly initialized. You can place the test cases in the provided funcs_objects_tests.py file.

Note that testing the fields of an object that are themselves objects requires a bit more work than one might initially expect. For instance, when verifying that a Circle has been properly initialized, you should not compare the center to another Point, but should instead compare each field of the center point (i.e., the center.x and center.y components) to the expected values. Comparing objects directly <em>can</em> be done, but doing so is beyond the scope of this lab.

Point      Circle

In the funcs_objects directory create a file named funcs_objects.py. Place your test cases in the provided funcs_objects_tests.py file.

You must provide at least two test cases for each of these functions. In order to test these functions, you will first need to create an appropriate number of objects and then call the function that you wish to test.

distance

Write a function, named distance, that takes two arguments of type Point and that returns the Euclidean distance between these two points.

circles_overlap

Write a function, named circles_overlap, that takes two arguments of type Circle and that returns True when the circles overlap and False otherwise (consider circles touching at the edge as non-overlapping). You must write this function using a relational operator and without using any sort of conditional.

As a helpful hint, two circles will overlap when the distance between their center points is less than the sum of the radii.

As experienced in the previous section of the lab, checking object equality by comparing each field individually is tedious. Though individual attribute comparisons are necessary to properly test the__init__ function, once object creation is known to work we would prefer to compare objects for equality in a simpler manner. This can be done by defining the __eq__ function within a class. We will use a simple definition of __eq__ to reduce the tedium of writing test cases (more sophisticated checks may be introduced in CPE 102).

When an object is compared to another value using ==, the default behavior is check if the two values are actually the same object (i.e., this is typically referred to as reference equality because both operands must refer to the same object for the check to return True). Instead, if you define the __eq__ function in the objectâ€™s class, then that function will be called when == is used. As such, the__eq__ can define what it means for the object to be equal to some other value (e.g., they may be considered equal only when each of their attributes is equal).

Copy your objects.py file into the object_equality directory. Modify the definition of the Point class to add (a simplified) __eq__ function. This function will take two arguments: self (the target of the call, much like with __init__) and other (the other operand). The function must return True when the x and y attributes in self are equal to the x and y attributes in other. Your function will assume that other has these attributes.

The attributes for a Point are typically of a floating point type. As such, you should use the epsilon_equal defined in utility.py when writing your __eq__ function. <em>We will discuss this function in class or lab.</em>

Tests

Modify object_equality_tests.py to test that your implementation of __eq__ behaves as expected. You can do so by using assertEqual to compare two Point objects.

Note that defining __eq__ does not change the behavior of the != operator. To do this you must define the __ne__ function for the class. Doing so is not required for this lab, but you might try defining__ne__ once you have completed the required portions of the lab.

<h1>List Comprehensions and Objects</h1>

Now lets practice working with lists of objects. Copy your updated objects.py from the previous part of the lab into the list_comp directory. Develop the functions below in the list_comp directory in filelist_comp.py.

<strong>Note:</strong> You must implement these functions using a <strong>list comprehension</strong>.

distance_all

Using the map pattern we learned in Lab 5, the distance_all function computes and returns a list containing the distance from the origin to the corresponding point in the input list. You may use your distance function from the first part of this lab if you like.

are_in_first_quadrant

Using the filter pattern we learned in Lab 5, the are_in_first_quadrant function returns all points in the input list that are in the first quadrant (i.e., both x- and y-components are positive) of the Cartesian plane.

Testing

Write two tests for each function above in list_comp_tests.py

Develop the following in the file directory in file.py.

Write a program that opens a file named in.txt and reads each line. For each line in the file, print the line number, the number of characters in the line, and the line itself. For example, given the following in.txt file:




I am a file.

This is a line.

This is the last line.




The output would be:




Line 0 (12 chars): I am a file.

Line 1 (15 chars): This is a line.

Line 2 (22 chars): This is the last line.

<h1>Demonstration</h1>

Demonstrate your tests for the first 3 parts of the lab and a sample run of file.py using the given example for in.txt. In addition, be prepared to show your instructor the source code for all parts of the lab.

Demo your work and submit your files in PolyLearn.
